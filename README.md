# OrderingSystem

This is a Ordering System devloped by me, Philip Geier. With this project I am trying to learn more about C# and .Net Core Development in general. 

# What will this program be able to do?
My plan with this project is to make a modern digital sollution for resteraunts and bars to take orders and make the life of waiters and waitresses easier.

# Why am I making it?
I have weekend job at a local restaurant, and they use a similar System to what I'm developing here, though it seems old, slow and as if it wasn't worked on for years. So I thought: "Why not devolpe a better version?". And here I am!
